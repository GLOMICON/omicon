# About the ontology

OMICON is an emerging ontology which links interoperating semantic solutions for omic observation. This will federate existing ontologies which provide semantics for field sampling, wet lab work, sequencing, and in silico analysis. Further, OMICON will provide identifiers for omically-enabled observatories and long-term observation series in the [Global Omics Observatory Network (GLOMICON)](https://www.atlantos-h2020.eu/events/workshop-on-enhancing-omics-observation/).

Please contact [PL Buttigieg](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088) for more information or to register your omics observatory.
